[00:08.56] Some deserts of this planet were oceans once
[00:15.65] Somewhere shrouded by the night, the sun will shine
[00:22.76] Sometimes I see a dying bird fall to the ground
[00:29.45] But it used to fly so high
[00:42.45] 
[00:35.88] I thought I were no more than a bystander
[00:40.23] 'Til I felt a touch so real
[00:42.82] I will no longer be a transient
[00:47.24] When I see smiles with tears
[00:50.08] If I have never known the sore of farewell
[00:54.13] And pain of sacrifices
[00:57.51] What else should I engrave on my mind?
[01:16.51] 
[01:05.03] Frozen into icy rocks
[01:08.43] That's how it starts (that's how it starts)
[01:12.29] Crumbled like the sands of time
[01:15.48] That's how it ends (that's how it ends)
[01:19.35] Every page of tragedy
[01:22.39] Is thrown away (is thrown away)
[01:26.23] Burned out in the flame
[01:37.73] 
[01:32.08] A shoulder for the past
[01:34.86] Let out the cries imprisoned for so long
[01:39.05] A pair of wings for me at this moment
[01:43.64] To soar above this world
[01:46.15] Turn into a shooting star
[01:48.95] That briefly shines but warms up every heart
[01:54.20] May all the beauty be blessed
[02:01.37] May all the beauty be blessed
[02:15.87] 
[02:09.58] I will never go
[02:16.62] There's a way back home
[02:22.89] Brighter than tomorrow and yesterday
[02:31.36] May all the beauty be blessed
[02:45.86] 
[02:42.62] Wave goodbye to the past when hope and faith
[02:47.03] Have grown so strong and sound
[02:49.02] (Have grown so strong and sound)
[02:49.98] Unfold this pair of wings for me again
[02:54.39] To soar above this world (soar above this world)
[02:56.79] Turned into a moon that always tells the warmth
[03:01.59] And brightness of the sun (and brightness of the sun)
[03:04.92] May all the beauty be blessed
[03:11.74] May all the beauty be blessed
